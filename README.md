🚗 Wireless Robotic Car using Arduino
This project implements a wireless, Bluetooth-controlled robotic car using an Arduino UNO and the Adafruit Motor Shield. The car is controlled via Bluetooth commands sent from a mobile device, allowing movement in all directions. The project was developed as part of the TechMaghi Internship with thorough testing and staged development.
